# Syllabus-condenser
This project is aimed at college students. The main issue with college students is that they don't get enough time to go through the previous years' question papers which is very important as there is a high chance that questions may be repeated and that's exactly where this project comes into place. This project uses the basics of [**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/natural-language-processing/) and [**OCR**](https://searchcontentmanagement.techtarget.com/definition/OCR-optical-character-recognition) and creates a simple predictive machine learning model which suggests only the important topics from the syllabus to study. Just upload the PDFs of the syllabus and previous ear question paper and *voilà!!!* you get the most repeated topics from which questions have been asked in past years
