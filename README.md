# Syllabus-condenser
This project is aimed towards college students. The main issue with college students is that they don't get enough time to  go through previous year question papers which is very important as there is high chance that questions may be repeated and that's exactly where this project comes in to place. This project uses the basics of [Natural Lnaguage Processing (NLP)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/natural-language-processing/) and [OCR](https://searchcontentmanagement.techtarget.com/definition/OCR-optical-character-recognition) and creates a simple predictive machine learning model which suggests only the important topics from the syllabus to study.
